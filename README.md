# Phase-1-Project
My first project on Data Science course
This project analyzes aviation accident data by following a structured approach. It begins by
loading two datasets, one containing aviation accidents and another with U.S. state codes, into
pandas DataFrames. The data is then inspected, and missing or invalid values are handled by
filling them based on related fields or removing incomplete entries. Duplicate values are
checked, followed by data transformation, including splitting location columns, merging
datasets, and converting columns to appropriate data types. The cleaned dataset is exported to
a CSV file for further analysis. Finally, the project includes visualizations, such as count plots of
incidents by aircraft category and time series plots showing trends in aviation incidents over the
years, to summarize the key findings.
